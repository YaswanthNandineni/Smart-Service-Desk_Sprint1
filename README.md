# Smart-Service-Desk_Sprint1
Sprint 1 sets up the backend foundation for the Smart Service Desk system with database modeling,  <br> Java OOP classes, JDBC integration, and basic ticket management using Oracle XE.
# Smart Service Desk - Cloud-Based Customer Support Platform
This project is a part of Sprint 1 for the SmartInternz Talent Program. <br>
It focuses on backend development using Java and Oracle XE for a hypothetical company, QuickHelp Inc., which provides IT support services.

# 🎯 Sprint 1 Goal
To design and implement the backend foundation of a smart ticketing system with support for:

* Java-based object-oriented design <br>
* Oracle XE database with normalized tables <br>
* JDBC integration for ticket and user operations <br>
* Exception handling and queue simulation <br>
* Auto-generated timestamps using Java's date/time API <br>

# 📦 Features Implemented
* 🗂️ Entity Classes: User, Agent, Category, and Ticket <br>
* 🛢️ Normalized Oracle Tables with foreign key constraints <br>
* 🔁 CRUD Operations for Users and Tickets <br>
* 🔌 JDBC Integration (Oracle thin driver) <br>
* ⚠️ Exception Handling for SQL and invalid input <br>
* ⏱️ Auto Timestamping for Ticket creation <br>
* 🧾 Ticket Queue Simulation using Java Collections <br>

# 🗃️ Technologies Used

* Java 21 <br>
* Oracle Database XE (21c) <br>
* JDBC <br>
* SQL*Plus / SQL Developer <br>
* Git & GitHub <br>

# 📁 How to Run
* Clone the repository <br>
* Import Java files and ensure Oracle JDBC driver is added to classpath <br>
* Create Oracle tables using provided SQL scripts <br>
* Run Main.java to create users, agents, categories, and tickets <br>
* Observe ticket processing queue and update ticket status dynamically <br>

# 📊 ER Diagram
* Included in the /docs folder along with normalization report. <br>

# ✅ Deliverables (Sprint 1)
* ✔️ Normalized ER Diagram <br>
* ✔️ Java classes with proper structure and validation <br>
* ✔️ SQL scripts and sample data <br>
* ✔️ JDBC program for ticket creation and management <br>
